# Integer Pointer Program

This program demonstrates basic memory management using dynamic allocation. It begins by allocating memory for three integer variables using the new operator, which returns pointers to the allocated memory. The program then prompts the user to input values for these integers, which are stored directly into the allocated memory. By using pointers and the dereference operator *, the program efficiently accesses and manipulates the stored values. After displaying these values, the program emphasizes proper memory management by deallocating the reserved memory using the delete operator. This step is crucial as it prevents memory leaks by returning the memory back to the system.
